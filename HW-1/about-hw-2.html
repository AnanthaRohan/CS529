        <h1>Black Hat to White Hat</h1>
        <p>
          In <b>Black Hat Visualization</b>, the map representation is biased and tries to mislead the viewer. This is done in multiple ways:
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>
                To begin with, the color scheme in the choropleth map makes it hard to differentiate between various states making it difficult to identify the states with more Gun violence. The Legend for the representation is also missing.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                The horizontal bar graphs for the male to female ratio representation -  the data is biased as while representing the males bar length, it is multiplied by 0.1 and for female bar it is multiplied by 1 - as a result, the bar graph looks similar for both males and females even though they have high difference in values.

              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                The above representation leads to a false title.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                Additional information is not provided about the visualization. More representation is necessary for better understanding about the data.
              </li> 
              </ul>
          </div>
           </p>
           <p>
            In <b>White Hat Visualization</b>, I have used color brewer to get a color scheme that has different contrast value on its scale. Additionally, added a filtering option that would let the users to view cities with information on the number of deaths through a tooltip. In order to view state wise statistics, users can click on the state to view information like Total Deaths. Through this representation, users can also know where major incidents have taken place. The following visualization was created following the Tufte and Munzer Principles.
